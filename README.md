**We are Sprout.**

Welcome to our universe. A growing ecosystem of collaborating people, ideas and initiatives.

# How we came to be

We've all been in the business for a few years. Colleagues have come and gone, projects and companies have changed in a world where technology is ever evolving. We've stayed on that path, with its ups and downs, following our passion for software.

Somewhere along that path we've met people that made a mark. People that inspired and challenged us, made us better or simply put a smile on our faces. People that are on our wavelength or expand our perspectives. People that bring out the very best version of ourselves.

After a while, we've realized _it's all about them_.
Those people.
Us.

Sprout is a collaborative, creative platform built with that in mind.

# Root values

## Life balance - the Sprout way

Life balance is more than a gym card. It means having the time and possibility follow your dreams & passions, with the people you love. We allow for highs and lows and take turns at the helm.

We want you to spend time with your loved ones. We do too!
Weâ€™ll invite them along on many of our events so that we expand our relationships. We know that you have them top-of-mind, so do we.

## No high-horses

With great knowledge and experience comes great responsibility. For us, it means staying humble and remaining open to new ideas and perspectives. An expert in their area might be a beginner in yours. With our feet steady on the ground, we're always happy to help.

## Hitting the ground running

Hiring us is not like hiring anyone else.
We hit the ground running and make an impact from day one. We bring energy, positivity and professionalism to any project.
And if you hire a whole Sprout team - watch that energy ðŸ’¥

## Hybrid, remote or office is all in the past

We don't spend time labelling your style of work. At Sprout we know that no one knows your best format like you do. That thing that makes you

## We are Sprout - Sprout is us.

We've built Sprout together, because we wanted to. Thereâ€™s no "company" - there is only us.
We donâ€™t blame anyone else for how things are. Weâ€™re it. Itâ€™s up to us.
If something needs fixing - fix it.
If something is awesome - say it, celebrate it!

## We grow slow

Sprout is founded by a group of people that wants to work together. It's a tight group, where we trust and appreciate eachother. We want to grow - but slowly. We're careful about how we expand and in what direction we choose to grow.
That being said - when we find that soul-mate-superstar,
weâ€™ll give them the best welcome theyâ€™ve ever seen!

## Commitment is doing that extra thing

We take those little extra steps, because we care.
About the projects we take on, our colleagues, end-users or our lines of code. We care. And it shows.

If that means stepping out of our role, comfort zone or the box completely - so be it.

And above all else - weâ€™re nice people.
We pay it forward, going a little bit out of our way to bring joy to someone else.
